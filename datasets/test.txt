Joe Biden has taken the lead in both Georgia and Pennsylvania today, putting him within touching distance of the White House.
The nail-biting final counts were still going to the wire but the latest figures confirmed that the momentum of the final hours was with the Democrat challenger.
This morning’s figures followed President Trump’s claim last night that he was the legal winner of the election. He called a press conference at the White House to complain at length about the postal voting system, which he claimed was “rigged” because the late returns were overwhelmingly for Mr Biden.
